# Final Deliverable
This is a final deliverable and only for reference of code. Think of this as an archive of all the code this trimester. This repository is not meant to pulled into an IDE and run there. It will not work. Below are some alternatives if you would like to see these programs run.

# Alternatives
Here are some alternatives to running this program in case you don't want to just reference the code and want to interact with it.
## Option 1: Original Repository
* Go to the original repository and pull from there to your IDE. The instructions for pulling and running will be posted in that README.md.
* The README.md in that original repository will also give you some insight into our project and some goals for that project. You will see project logs that will help you track our journey throughout Trimester 1 of Computer Science Principles.
* Project Page (Portfolio) Repository: https://github.com/PragadeeshRaj/Project-Page
* Calculator Page Repository: https://github.com/PragadeeshRaj/CalculatorPage
## Option 2: Use the Runtime Link for our Portfolio
* Note: This option is only for the portfolio, the calculator website is not hosted on a server and must be manually pulled up with option 1.
* Click on the this link: http://76.176.59.167/ or type 76.176.59.167 onto your browser window. 
* If you go with this option, you will unfortunately not be able to see our README.md explaining our progress and ways you can interact with the website. You can always visit our repository from Option 1 and take a look at the README without even pulling.

# Navigation
* To navigate through this repository, make sure to view the different branch options.
* This **main** branch has the portfolio (also known as our Project Page). 
* The **Calculator-Project** branch has our calculator project.
* This README can be found in both branches, so you can refer to these details wherever you are in the repository!

# End Note
* To learn more about navigating through our website and operating our various calculators you can view the README.mds or even better; you can watch our video guide that will be coming soon!
